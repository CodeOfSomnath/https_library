## About

When we want to use https request in c language there is no way we can do it using c standard library. Only one option we have, the third party libraries but till now there is not a single third party library is easy to use and well documented. 

I know we have libcurl and wget libraries to do so but they are too complex to setup and also
I am a student so I want to make my own library.

Feel free to review code and raise an issue if there any
